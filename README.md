# C++ DSA Practice Repository 🚀

Welcome to **C++ DSA Practice Repository**, a clean, well-structured, and fully tested collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms** implemented in **C++**.

This repository will help you:

* Strengthen **problem-solving** skills.
* Learn **clean and optimal C++ coding practices**.
* Prepare for **coding interviews**.
* Understand DSA concepts deeply with **clear, modular code**.

## 🚩 What's Inside

✅ **Clean C++ Code with Comments**
✅ **Structured Folder Organization**
✅ Covers:

* Arrays & Strings
* Linked Lists
* Stacks & Queues
* Trees & Binary Search Trees
* Graphs (BFS, DFS, Topological Sort)
* Sorting & Searching Algorithms
* Dynamic Programming
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Sliding Window & Two Pointers
* Bit Manipulation
* Interview Problem Practice

✅ **Edge case handling in each implementation**
✅ Test cases to verify correctness
